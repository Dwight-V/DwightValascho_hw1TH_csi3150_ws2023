            Same as above, just phone problems. Learned a lot about how desk

            Learned much about continuous integration/delivery (CI/CD). This was

            Mostly waited around for students to ask me questions. I was

            Was an SI lead for a class called "Calculus for the Social

          I have the affliction of being a gamer, though not as much as in high
          school. During my second year of college, I switched focus to making
          art. I try to draw daily and have steadily improved these past two
          years.
